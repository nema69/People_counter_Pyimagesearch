# KI Pedestrian Counter
*Project "Mechanische Integration WS 2021/22". Counting Pedestrians using computer vision on a Nvidia Jetson Nano 4GB.*

For the course "Mechanische Integration WS 21/22" held by Prof. Dr. Leibl and Prof. Dr. Steinkogler in cooperation with the "Stadt München Referat Mobilität" our group developed a pedestrian counting system using computer vision.

Features include:
 - Webserver for setup and control
 - Support for different Tracking Algorithms (cv2.CSRT, cv2.KCF, dlib correlation Tracker)
 - MobileNetSSD using Caffe Framework
 - Centroid Tracking ID algorithm
 - Ouput of CSV files with number and direction of detected Pedestrians
 - GPU acceleration on supported Hardware
 - Optimized performance by threading of workload
